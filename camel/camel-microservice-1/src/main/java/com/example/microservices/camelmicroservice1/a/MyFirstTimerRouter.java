/* W H Y   P R O C E S S O R ?
 * Why do we need to implement `Processor` interface?
 * In Apache Camel we need to implement `Processor` interface to define custom processing logic
 * for messages in a route. This can be useful when you need to perform specific actions on a
 * message before it is sent to its final destination.
 *
 * By implementing the `Processor` interface, you can:
 * 1. Modify the message content - you can use `Processor` to add, remove or update information
 *       in the message before it is sent to the final destination.
 * 2. Add custom headers - You can add custom headers to the message to store additional message
 *       that can be used later in the route.
 * 3. Apply transformation - You can use the `Processor` to apply transformations to the message,
 *       such as converting the message to a different format or encrypting/decrypting sensitive
 *       information.
 * 4. Trigger side effects - You can use the `Processor` to trigger side effects, such as logging
 *       information, updating a database, or sending notifications.
 *
 * By implementing custom processing logic using the `Processor`, you can make your routes more
 * flexible and easily adapt to changing requirements.
