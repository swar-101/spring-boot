# Processor interface
In Apache Camel, you can implement the `Processor` interface to define custom processing logic for messages in a route. 
This can be useful when you need to perform specific actions on a message before it is sent to the final destination.

By implementing the processor, you can do the following:

1. Modify the message content - You can use the `Processor` to add, remove or update information in the message before it is sent to its final destination.
2. Add custom headers - You can add custom header to the message to store additional messaage that can be used later in the route.
3. Apply transformation - You can use the `Processor` to apply transformations to the message, such as converting the message to different format or encrypting/decrypting sensible information.
4. Trigger side effects - You can use the `Processor` to trigger side effects, such as logging information, updating database, or sending notification.

By implementing custom processing logic using the `Processor`, you can make routes more flexible and easily adapt to changing requirements.



<span style="color:gray">_What do you mean by side effects?<br>
In software development, a side effect refers to an action or computation that has an observable effect outside the function being executed.
In the context of Apache Camel, a side effect could refer to an action that is triggered as part of the processing of message in a route, but is not related directly to the message._</span>

Examples of side effects in Apache Camel could include:

1. **Logging** - You could use a `Processor` to log information about the message being processed, such as content, header or time it was processed.
2. **Updating a database** - You could use a `Processor` to update database with information from the message, such as storing information about the message for auditing purposes.
3. **Sending notification** - You could use a `Processor` to send notifications, such as sending an email or an SMS message, based on the content of the message that is being processed.
4. **Trigger other processes** - You could use a `Processor` to trigger other processes, such as starting a long-running task or sending notification to another system.

In general, side effects are used to perform actions that are not directly related to the processing of the message, but are still important for the overall functioning of the system.
