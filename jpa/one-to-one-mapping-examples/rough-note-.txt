Use HTTP Verbs: RESTful APIs are built around HTTP verbs. Use GET for retrieving resources, POST for creating a new resource, PUT for updating an existing resource, and DELETE for deleting a resource.

Use Nouns: Use nouns to name your resources, and use plural nouns for collections. For example, use /books for a collection of books and /books/{id} for a specific book.

Use HTTP Status Codes: Use the appropriate HTTP status codes to represent the outcome of a request. For example, use 200 OK for a successful response, 404 Not Found for a resource that does not exist, and 500 Internal Server Error for a server-side error.

Use Query Parameters: Use query parameters to filter, sort, or paginate results. For example, use /books?author=Stephen+King to filter books by author.

Use Request and Response Body: Use request and response bodies to send and receive data in JSON or XML format. Use the appropriate data types to represent the data.

Use Pagination: Use pagination to limit the amount of data returned in a response. Use query parameters to specify the page number and page size.

Use Hypermedia: Use hypermedia to provide links to related resources. Use HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) to provide links to actions that can be performed on a resource.

Use Spring Security: Use Spring Security to secure your APIs. Use OAuth2 to provide authentication and authorization for your APIs.

Use Swagger: Use Swagger to document your APIs. Use the Swagger UI to test your APIs.

Use Unit Tests: Use unit tests to test your APIs. Use the Spring MVC Test framework to test your APIs.

What are the best software engineering practices when writing the code for RESTful APIs in Spring Boot A
Here are some best software engineering practices when writing code for RESTful APIs in a Spring Boot application:

Use SOLID principles: Follow SOLID principles, such as the Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle, to create maintainable and extensible code.

Use Design Patterns: Use design patterns such as Factory, Builder, Singleton, and Strategy to improve the design and maintainability of your code.

Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Use DTOs to transfer data between your RESTful API and the client application. DTOs can help to decouple the API from the data model and provide a clean separation of concerns.

Use Exception Handling: Use exception handling to handle errors and provide informative error messages to the client. Use Spring's Exception Handling mechanism to handle exceptions and return appropriate HTTP status codes.

Use Logging: Use logging to record application events and errors. Use a logging framework such as Logback or Log4j to log messages to a file or a centralized logging system.

Use Caching: Use caching to improve the performance of your RESTful API. Use Spring's Caching mechanism to cache the results of frequently accessed API endpoints.

Use Validation: Use validation to ensure that the client input is valid. Use Spring's Validation mechanism to validate input data and return appropriate error messages.

Use Security: Use security to protect your RESTful API from unauthorized access. Use Spring Security to secure your API and provide authentication and authorization.

Use Testing: Use testing to ensure that your RESTful API works as expected. Use JUnit and Spring MVC Test to write unit and integration tests for your API.

Use Documentation: Use documentation to provide information about your RESTful API. Use tools such as Swagger to generate API documentation and provide a user-friendly interface for developers to test and interact with your API.
