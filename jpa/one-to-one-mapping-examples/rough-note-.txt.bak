Use HTTP Verbs: RESTful APIs are built around HTTP verbs. Use GET for retrieving resources, POST for creating a new resource, PUT for updating an existing resource, and DELETE for deleting a resource.

Use Nouns: Use nouns to name your resources, and use plural nouns for collections. For example, use /books for a collection of books and /books/{id} for a specific book.

Use HTTP Status Codes: Use the appropriate HTTP status codes to represent the outcome of a request. For example, use 200 OK for a successful response, 404 Not Found for a resource that does not exist, and 500 Internal Server Error for a server-side error.

Use Query Parameters: Use query parameters to filter, sort, or paginate results. For example, use /books?author=Stephen+King to filter books by author.

Use Request and Response Body: Use request and response bodies to send and receive data in JSON or XML format. Use the appropriate data types to represent the data.

Use Pagination: Use pagination to limit the amount of data returned in a response. Use query parameters to specify the page number and page size.

Use Hypermedia: Use hypermedia to provide links to related resources. Use HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) to provide links to actions that can be performed on a resource.

Use Spring Security: Use Spring Security to secure your APIs. Use OAuth2 to provide authentication and authorization for your APIs.

Use Swagger: Use Swagger to document your APIs. Use the Swagger UI to test your APIs.

Use Unit Tests: Use unit tests to test your APIs. Use the Spring MVC Test framework to test your APIs.
